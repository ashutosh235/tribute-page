            <h3 id="headline">Childhood & Early Life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Born on February 24, 1955, Steve Paul Jobs was the adopted son of Paul Reinhold and Clara Jobs. His
                    biological parents were Abdulfattah ‘John’ Jandali and Joanne Carole Schieble, who could not raise
                    Steve, as their parents objected to their relationship.</li>
                <li>Ever since a young age, Jobs was exposed to the world of mechanics. He would spent long hours with
                    his father, dismantling and rebuilding electronic devices in the family garage. It was these
                    experiences that gave the little boy tenacity and mechanical prowess.</li>
                <li>Academically, after passing his high school in 1972, he enrolled at the Reed College but dropped out
                    of the same in a time frame of six months to pursue creative classes, including a course on
                    calligraphy.</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.
                    Don't settle.”</p>

            </blockquote>

            <h3 id="headline">Career:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>His first move professionally was that of a technician at Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California, in
                    1973.</li>
                <li>In mid-1974, Jobs went to India to meet Neem Karoli Baba for spiritual enlightenment. Before he
                    could meet Neem Karoli Baba, the Baba died and after a brief hiatus of about seven months, Jobs
                    returned to Atari to create a circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout.</li>
                <li>Along with Wozniak, he developed a circuit board eliminating about 50 chips from the machine thereby
                    making the same compact. Next was the development of the digital ‘blue box’, which allowed free-long
                    distance calls. It was the positive response of the blue box that instilled in him the need to make
                    it big in electronics.</li>
                <li>In 1976, along with Wozniak, he founded ‘Apple Computer Company’. Initially, the company mainly
                    aimed at selling circuit boards. Same year, Wozniak invented the Apple I computer.</li>
                <li>In 1985, difference of opinion between him and the company’s CEO John Sculley led to Jobs resigning
                    from his own founded company. In the same year, he founded NeXT Inc. The company was famous for its
                    technical strengths especially its object-oriented software development system.</li>
                <li>In 1986, he bought the Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm's computer graphics
                    division. ‘Toy Story’ was the first animation film that was released after the acquirement.</li>
                <li>Interestingly, in 1996, when Apple acquired NeXT Inc, he returned to his own co-founded company as a
                    de facto chief in the company and was formally named interim chief executive.</li>
                <li>Under his guidance, a number of projects were disbanded. He introduced a whole new range of products
                    which steeply increased the sales of the company, making it one of the electronic giants in the
                    world.</li>
                <li>In 1998, Apple iMac was introduced to the world. It was the direct result of his return to Apple.
                    iMac went through a changeover in look in the following year and the world was introduced the
                    Graphite grey Apple iMac. Since then, there have been various variations that iMac has gone through.
                </li>
                <li>In 2000, he became the permanent CEO of Apple, adopting the title, iCEO. History was in the making
                    as the company soon branched out bringing about improved digital appliances.</li>
                <li>In 2001, the company sortied into the world of music with the introduction of iPod, iTunes digital
                    music software and iTunes Store. The device was an instant hit and enhanced the sales and reputation
                    of the company by leaps and bounds. The first generation of iPod gave way to revised
                    consumer-friendly devices such as iPod classic, iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod shuffle.</li>
                <li>In 2005, with Disney’s purchase of Pixar, he became the largest shareholder of Walt Disney Company
                    with approximately 7% of the company’s stock. He served as one of the board members in the company.
                </li>
                <li>In 2007, he forayed into cellular phone business with the launch of iPhone and rest as they say is
                    history. With its multi touch display, own mobile browser, in-built iPod, the iPhone revolutionized
                    the way the world looked towards a cellular device.</li>
                <li>In the following years, he worked on the iPhone to come up with improvised versions. In 2008, iPhone
                    3G was released with three chief features: support for GPS, 3G data and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA; in
                    2009, iPhone 3GS was launched.</li>
                <li>In 2010, he launched iPhone 4, which was a sleeker model than its successors and included enhanced
                    features like five megapixel camera, secondary front facing camera with 4G capability.</li>
                <li>In 2011, iPhone 4S was released which included Siri, a virtual assistant that is capable of voice
                    recognition. In the same year, he resigned as the CEO of Apple but continued to serve as the
                    chairman of the company’s board.</li>
